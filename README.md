# ShortcutsCLI
An open source reimplementation of macOS 12's shortcuts CLI tool.

# Supported Platforms

- iOS 13+ jailbroken devices (be aware that contact signing is only iOS 15+)

# Supported (Self-Compilation required)
- tvOS 13+ jailbroken (untested but should work fine with changes to the compile script... contact signing will be 15+ only though)
- macOS 12+ (and *maybe* older versions? change the compile script, and figure out how to sign the binary with the entitlements you need, and it should be good)
- watchOS 8+ (obviously untested since there's no watchOS jailbreak, but it *should* work with compilation script changes...)
